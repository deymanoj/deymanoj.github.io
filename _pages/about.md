Hi, I am Manoj Dey, currently a postdoctoral researcher at the NOMAD Laboratory of the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Gesellschaft in Berlin, Germany. I completed my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Abhishek K. Singh at the Materials Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science (Hons.) from Bankura Christian College, W.B., followed by a Master of Science in Physics from The University of Burdwan, W.B., India.

My broad research interest lies in Computational Materials Science and Condensed Matter Physics, with a focus on defects and quasi-particle dynamics, photocatalysis, and quantum computation. Currently, my research is centered on the engineering of defects in semiconductors for electronic and optoelectronic applications using first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. I investigate the thermodynamic, electronic, optical, and catalytic properties of defects in semiconducting materials across various dimensions (from 1D to 3D).

Currently, I'm diving deep into the fascinating worlds of Machine Learning and Materials Informatics to enhance my research and development skills in these cutting-edge fields. Feel free to connect or explore my projects to learn more about my journey and contributions.
