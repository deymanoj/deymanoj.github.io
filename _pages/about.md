Hi, I am Manoj Dey. I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the NOMAD Laboratory of the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Gesellschaft, Berlin, Germany. I have completed my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Abhishek K. Singh at the Materials Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. I obtained my Bachelor of Science (Hons.) from Bankura Christian College, W.B., and Master of Science in physics from The University of Burdwan, W.B., India. My broad research interest is computational materials science and condensed matter physics mostly on defects and quasi-particle dynamics, photocatalysis, and quantum computation. Currently, my research focus is on the engineering of defects in semiconductors for electronic and optoelectronic applications from first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. My research area includes the investigation of thermodynamic, electronic, optical, and catalytic properties of defects in various dimensional (from 1D to 3D) semiconducting materials. I am an expert in implementing modern research methodologies to investigate material properties.
